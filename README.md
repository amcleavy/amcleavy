- 👋 Hi, I’m @amcleavy, a high energy, funny-talking Talent Pertner at GitHub 
- 👀 I’m a self-proclaimed tech-nerd (with a severe lack of tech skills) interested in sports, travelling, reading and living life!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub, SQL, and how to file taxes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects, mostly around recruiting technology and data analytics.
- 📫 You can reach me via my GitHub Handle, or connect with me via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-mcleavy-179160112/
